                 Software organizations have successfully implemented
                 agile scrum in distributed software development.
                 However, they also encountered many challenges while
                 implementation which led to considerable amount of
                 effort spend just to manage work. Difficulties were
                 primarily in the areas of communication, culture,
                 different time zones, different level of domain know
                 how across scrum teams, and knowledge management. In
                 this practice paper, we will share practices and

                 separate but similar fields, as both are instances of
                 complex problem solving in environments with ever
                 changing requirements. Our research hypothesis is that
                 modifications to agile software development based on
                 inspirations from mission command can improve the
                 software engineering process in terms of planning,
                 prioritizing, and communication of software
                 requirements and progress, as well as improving the
                 overall software product. Targeted Scrum is a
                 modification of Traditional Scrum based on three
                 inspirations from Mission Command: End State, Line of
                 Effort, and Targeting. These inspirations have led to
                 the introduction of the Product Design Meeting and
                 modifications of some current Scrum meetings and
                 artifacts. We tested our research hypothesis using a
                 semester-long undergraduate level software engineering
                 class. Students developed two software projects, one
                 using Traditional Scrum and the other using Targeted
                 Scrum. We then assessed how well both methodologies
                 assisted the software development teams in planning and
                 developing the software architecture, prioritizing
                 requirements, and communicating progress. We also
                 evaluated the software product produced by both
                 methodologies. We found that Targeted Scrum did better
                 in assisting the software development teams in the
                 planning and prioritization of the requirements.
                 However, Targeted Scrum had a negligible effect on
                 improving the software development teams external and
                 internal communications. Finally, Targeted Scrum did
                 not have an impact on the product quality by the top
                 performing and worst performing teams. Targeted Scrum
                 did assist the product quality of the teams in the
                 middle of the performance spectrum.",

                 Lankan context. The trend in the recent software
                 development industry is to move towards OSD. Issues and
                 challenges related to OSD have to be solved to gain
                 success. Scrum has gained a significant attention due
                 to its flexible approach to managing requirement
                 volatility and emphasis on extensive collaboration
                 between customer and development team. However, the
                 geographical and cultural distance of offshore teams

                 those issues and challenges can be overcome by using

                 burden was placed to the individual. In the fiscal year

                 paper considers the issue by examining whether Scrum
                 practices, used in four global software development
                 projects to leverage the benefits of Agile methods over

                 whether the mitigation mechanisms employed relate to

                 it possible to observe the behavior of developers using

                 project domain expert playing the role of the Product

                 also leads to multiple complications such as
                 deteriorated communications. Among the most widespread
                 methodologies for software development is the Rational
                 Unified Process (RUP). However, in recent decades a
                 series of methodologies have emerged, called {"}agile

                 quickly, focusing on people and frequent delivery of
                 software. Of the existing agile methodologies, Scrum is
                 one of the most widely-applied, due to its ability to
                 complement other methods and processes. For this

                 suitable for the distributed management and deployment

                 and Scrum, called scRumUP, which has been so designed

                 evidence demonstrate that organisations worldwide are
                 adopting agile software development methods at
                 increasing speed. Little is still known about the
                 current usefulness of agile methods in the complex
                 environment of the embedded software development
                 industry. Embedded devices are already commonplace in
                 regular households. The goal of this survey is to
                 provide first-hand knowledge of the adoption and
                 experience of two of the most known agile methods,
                 namely Extreme Programming and Scrum, in a number of
                 European organisations of embedded software known to be
                 interested and active in experimenting with agile
                 software development methods. The survey involved 13
                 industrial organisations in eight European countries
                 and 35 individual software development projects. The
                 focus of the questionnaire was to enquire into the

                 expected usefulness if there was no experience
                 available - of the two agile methods and their
                 individual practices. The results show that the
                 embedded industry has been able to apply agile methods
                 in its development processes. The results also indicate
                 that the appreciation of the agile methods and their

                 Based on virtual instrument and predictive control, the

                 harvest storage methods. Food stored under improper
                 storage conditions are prone to increased respiration
                 and transpiration processes which often result in
                 depletion and weight loss of edible material. Storage
                 temperature and relative humidity are major factors
                 that ultimately determine product quality and quantity.
                 This paper presents a survey on methods of post harvest
                 storage systems. The indigenous methods of tropical
                 food storage common to the West African region are
                 discussed. The attendant problems associated with these
                 methods are highlighted. Intelligent control methods
                 are also discussed. A novel intelligent controller is

                 optimizing the storage process.",
