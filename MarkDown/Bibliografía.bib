abstract={Agile software development approach aims at overcoming the limitations of plan-driven software development by allowing requirement changes during all phases of product development and providing agility to organization to respond to changing market needs. Software organizations have successfully implemented agile scrum in distributed software development. However, they also encountered many challenges while implementation which led to considerable amount of effort spend just to manage work. Difficulties were primarily in the areas of communication, culture, different time zones, different level of domain know how across scrum teams, and knowledge management. In this practice paper, we will share practices and systems implemented, challenges encountered along with their countermeasures, and lessons learnt in successfully scaling the Agile Scrum development to 16 globally distributed scrum teams with 100+ team members, successfully delivering 2000+ user stories which required execution of 3000+ product test cases and 1000+ system test cases for verification and validation in a single version of platform release Providing Agility and Quality to Platform Development by Reducing Time to Market.},

abstract={In Brazil there are several small software companies with only one developer (solo developer). In a survey conducted by Secretaria de Política de Informática of Ministério de Ciência e Tecnologia has been indicated that about 60% of market consolidated software companies started their activities with a single developer. The majority of these developers does not formally make use of a software process. At this point, this work aims to present a formal software process for solo developers - the Scrum Solo. Initially, the defined procedure was experienced in software development for the Laboratório de Inovação of Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná. Afterwards, several students made use of Scrum Solo to elaborate their completion of course works. Nowadays, plenty software companies working with individual development benefit from the process described in this document.},

title={Targeted Scrum: Applying Mission Command to Agile Software Development}, 
year={2016}, 
volume={42}, 
number={5}, 
pages={476-489}, 
abstract={Software engineering and mission command are two separate but similar fields, as both are instances of complex problem solving in environments with ever changing requirements. Our research hypothesis is that modifications to agile software development based on inspirations from mission command can improve the software engineering process in terms of planning, prioritizing, and communication of software requirements and progress, as well as improving the overall software product. Targeted Scrum is a modification of Traditional Scrum based on three inspirations from Mission Command: End State, Line of Effort, and Targeting. These inspirations have led to the introduction of the Product Design Meeting and modifications of some current Scrum meetings and artifacts. We tested our research hypothesis using a semester-long undergraduate level software engineering class. Students developed two software projects, one using Traditional Scrum and the other using Targeted Scrum. We then assessed how well both methodologies assisted the software development teams in planning and developing the software architecture, prioritizing requirements, and communicating progress. We also evaluated the software product produced by both methodologies. We found that Targeted Scrum did better in assisting the software development teams in the planning and prioritization of the requirements. However, Targeted Scrum had a negligible effect on improving the software development teams external and internal communications. Finally, Targeted Scrum did not have an impact on the product quality by the top performing and worst performing teams. Targeted Scrum did assist the product quality of the teams in the middle of the performance spectrum.},

abstract={This paper presents the results of a comprehensive literature survey and a web based survey on the use of Scrum in offshore software development (OSD) in Sri Lankan context. The trend in the recent software development industry is to move towards OSD. Issues and challenges related to OSD have to be solved to gain success. Scrum has gained a significant attention due to its flexible approach to managing requirement volatility and emphasis on extensive collaboration between customer and development team. However, the geographical and cultural distance of offshore teams create challenges for use Scrum with OSD. Hence objectives of the research was to identify issues and challenges related to OSD in Sri Lankan context and how those issues and challenges can be overcome by using Scrum. Results of the study reveal that key factors of Scrum such as communication, people, process, and organizational factors are having positive contribution towards OSD success in Sri Lankan context. This study further reveals the importance of combining engineering practices with Scrum to achieve the success in OSD in Sri Lankan context.},

abstract={In a traditional software engineering class, students are typically engaged in theoretical lectures followed by homework assignments or a project. Use of hands-on training and laboratory activities using real-world projects is more likely to produce students with a higher level of achievement and more confidence in the course material. If every topic or technique introduced in the course has a corresponding hands-on activity that demonstrates an application or use of the concept in the industry, students better understand the need for the technique and the learning environment is more interactive, engaging, and interesting to students. This paper presents a project called ScrumTutor that aims at providing an engaging learning experience of Scrum Software development process through a web-based Interactive tutorial. It is designed and developed for undergraduate students in introductory Software Engineering courses. This software tool introduces its users to modern software engineering methodology used these days in the software industry known as Agile Software Development that includes the Scrum framework for managing software projects or products.},

In the fiscal year 2011, the agile technique adopted as the software development process, and the small-scale project was tried. However, there were problems like the shortage of communication between members, the customers and difference of a member's technical capabilities and the burden was placed to the individual. In the fiscal year 2012/2013, in order to solve these problems, the development process "Scrum" was adopted. We analyzed the result of projects. In the result, Scrum was being able to perform problem solving in which the member's diversity was harnessed. It could carry out improved relations as the team by the positive participation in customer's projects. And, it could build the communication base by "making the place team". Therefore, we understood using Scrum for success of projects.},

For 60- of CMMI practices, which are insufficiently covered by Scrum they add new practices that improve discipline while maintaining agility. The practices to improve an actual software development process are selected from the reference model with the P-Sel algorithm based on answers to a questionnaire with 25 single-choice questions.

abstract={Global software development is a major trend in software engineering. Practitioners are increasingly trying Agile methods in distributed projects to tap into the benefits experienced by co-located teams. This paper considers the issue by examining whether Scrum practices, used in four global software development projects to leverage the benefits of Agile methods over traditional software engineering methods, provided any distinctive advantage in mitigating coordination challenges. Four temporal, geographical and socio-cultural distance-based coordination challenges and seven scrum practices are identified from the literature. The cases are analyzed for evidence of use of the Scrum practices to mitigate each challenge and whether the mitigation mechanisms employed relate to any distinctive characteristics of the Scrum method. While some mechanisms used were common to other/ traditional methods, it was found that Scrum offers a distinctive advantage in mitigating geographical and socio-cultural but not temporal distance-based GSD coordination challenges. Implications are discussed.},

Among the most widespread methodologies for software development is the Rational Unified Process (RUP). However, in recent decades a series of methodologies have emerged, called "agile methodologies", which aim to develop software quickly, focusing on people and frequent delivery of software. Of the existing agile methodologies, Scrum is one of the most widely-applied, due to its ability to complement other methods and processes. For this reason, the strategies proposed by Scrum may be suitable for the distributed management and deployment of the phases and disciplines of RUP.

Moreover, little is known about what the key challenges or risks are, and how GSD project mangers deal with these risks while using agile practices. We conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) following existing guidelines to identify primary papers that discuss the use of Scrum practices in GSD projects. We identify key challenges, due to global project distribution, that restrict the use of Scrum and explore the strategies used by project managers to deal with these challenges.

pages={175-184}, 
abstract={There is a growing interest in applying agile practices in global software development (GSD) projects. The literature on using Scrum, one of the most popular agile approaches, in distributed development projects has steadily been growing. However, there has not been any effort to systematically select, review, and synthesize the literature on this topic. We have conducted a systematic literature review of the primary studies that report using Scrum practices in GSD projects. Our search strategy identified 366 papers, of which 20 were identified as primary papers relevant to our research. We extracted data from these papers to identify various challenges of using Scrum in GSD. Current strategies to deal with the identified challenges have also been extracted. This paper presents the reviewpsilas findings that are expected to help researchers and practitioners to understand the challenges involved in using Scrum for GSD projects and the strategies available to deal with them.},

title={Agile methods in European embedded software development organisations: a survey on the actual use and usefulness of Extreme Programming and Scrum}, 
year={2008}, 
volume={2}, 
number={1}, 
pages={58-64}, 
abstract={Press releases, scientific publications and anecdotal evidence demonstrate that organisations worldwide are adopting agile software development methods at increasing speed. Little is still known about the current usefulness of agile methods in the complex environment of the embedded software development industry. Embedded devices are already commonplace in regular households. The goal of this survey is to provide first-hand knowledge of the adoption and experience of two of the most known agile methods, namely Extreme Programming and Scrum, in a number of European organisations of embedded software known to be interested and active in experimenting with agile software development methods. The survey involved 13 industrial organisations in eight European countries and 35 individual software development projects. The focus of the questionnaire was to enquire into the level of use as well as the experienced usefulness - or expected usefulness if there was no experience available - of the two agile methods and their individual practices. The results show that the embedded industry has been able to apply agile methods in its development processes. The results also indicate that the appreciation of the agile methods and their individual practices appears to increase once adopted and applied in practice.},

abstract={Security engineering and agile development are often perceived as a clash of cultures. To address this clash, several approaches have been proposed that allow for agile security engineering. Unfortunately, agile development organization differ in their actual procedures and environmental properties resulting in varying requirements. We propose an approach to compare and select methods for agile security engineering. Furthermore, our approach addresses adaptation or construction of a tailored method taking the existing development culture into account. We demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal and report early experiences from its application within a small development organization for digital solutions in the automotive domain.},

In a survey conducted by Secretaria de Política de Informática of Ministério de Ciência e Tecnologia has been indicated that about 60% of market consolidated software companies started their activities with a single developer. The majority of these developers does not formally make use of a software process. At this point, this work aims to present a formal software process for solo developers - the Scrum Solo. Initially, the defined procedure was experienced in software development for the Laboratório de Inovação of Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná. Afterwards, several students made use of Scrum Solo to elaborate their completion of course works. Nowadays, plenty software companies working with individual development benefit from the process described in this document.},
